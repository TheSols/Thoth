# Thoth

This is a simple keyboard widget created using Qt.

 
## Getting Started

You can clone/fork the entire repository which has everything you need, as well as a driver.

The keyboard was built using Qt 11.0.0 and should work fine for any greater version.

## Footnotes
Just in case you were wondering: I name all of my projects after deities. This one named Thoth after the Egyptian god of wisdom, **writing**, hieroglyphs, science, magic, art, judgment, and the dead.
